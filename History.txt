==0.1.4 / 2009-08-19
Implemented callbacks, you can now hook into the ticket life-cycle with before and after create and update.
Saving works like ActiveRecord now, with save returning true if successful and false otherwise, and save! raising an error if unsuccessful.
Creating tickets is more ActiveRecord like now, with new not saving to the ticketing system automatically, you must call save or save!. There is a create function to do this now. Although this does break backward compatability, I'm not going to bump the minor because a) nobody has forked this yet, and b) i skipped 0.
You can now specify a default queue when you subclass Roart::Ticket. just add a default_queue 'queue name' to your class and that queue will automatically be searched unless you specify a queue.

==0.1.3 / 2009-08-18
